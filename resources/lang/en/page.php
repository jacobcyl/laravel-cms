With the support of top technologies from Shanghai Research Institute of Silicate (CAS), Xi’an Jiaotong University, Central Iron&Steel Research Institute, Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (CAS), we invented a novel micro-grooves impeller shape hydrodynamic gas lubrication rotor-bearing system, and a new hybrid hydrodynamic gas bearing based on the micro-grooves impeller shape gas bearing and the idea about compliant foil hydrodynamic gas bearing. We are the only company who has the ability and the related intellectual property to development new hydrodynamic gas lubrication rotor-bearing system in China. We are becoming one of the world’s leaders in the field of R&D, design, manufacturing about hydrodynamic gas lubrication rotor-bearing system technology.',
